#### 📊⚙️Chart mechanics:
The chart works like that:
####  Day 1 = 
####  Expense amount for example 10 with 
####  daily income of 100$ 
####  balance 90$
####  Day 2 = Unless additional earning will be 10
####  Balance 100$

#### but if not 90$ balance will be for the rest of the days (kinda passing by through out the days the expense and additional earning)

## ✨🤔Inspiration:
The inspiration came to me from the simple fact that there is no simple app to track the expenses, so i created mine, enjoy using

## 🤔🤔🤔Will be there different versions of the app for different platforms:

Currently im working on the Linux binary, but the windows one or macOS, i need someone that have this specific hardware, because its impossible to compile the app from the linux to windows or MacOS or iPhone(.ipa)

#Current bugs to fix out:

Chart bugs out when income or expense is too high (the labels on y axis)
Zoom in and Zoom out does not scale right as should corresponding to grid
